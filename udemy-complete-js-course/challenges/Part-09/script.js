// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from
// before.
// Your tasks:

// 1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, TODODONE
// along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
// 2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already TODODONE
// studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
// 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this: TODODONE
// Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
// Odd of draw: 3.25
//  Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
// Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
// (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
// same property names ðŸ˜‰
// 4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the TODO
// players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this
// game, it will look like this:
// {
//   Gnarby: 1,
//   Hummels: 1,
//   Lewandowski: 2
// }

// Coding Challenge #1
// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
// next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
// Your tasks:

// 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and DONE
// 'players2')
// 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field DONE
// players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
// goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
// field players
// 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 DONE
// players)
// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a DONE
// new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
// 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
// 5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called DONE
// 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
// 6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player DONE
// names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
// number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
// 7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which DONE
// team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
// operator.
// Test data for 6.: First, use players c.
// Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
