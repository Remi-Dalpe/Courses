// Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are

// Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the
// recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
// Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10%
// above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate DONE
// the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
// not create a new array, simply loop over the array.
// HIGH .forEACH
// (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too DONE
// little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
// the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) ü§ì
// HIGH .find
// 3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much DONE
// ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
// ('ownersEatTooLittle').
// HIGH .filter
// 4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and DONE
// Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat
// too little!"
// 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food DONE
// that is recommended (just true or false)
// HIGH .some
// 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food DONE
// (just true or false)
// HIGH .some
// 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try DONE
// to reuse the condition used in 6.)
// 8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food DONE
// portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the
// array's objects üòâ)
// HIGH .sort

// Hints:
// ¬ß Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary
// lecture to choose between them üòâ
// ¬ß Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means:
// current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended *
// 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the
